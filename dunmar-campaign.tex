\section{About this Document}
This document serves as a record of the campaign I run using the Dunmar DM Guide for my players.

\section{The Standard Campaign}
The standard campaign is a log of the campaign run by Ernest "edg3" Loveland for his party, your mileage may vary with this campaign directly as parts of it were tailored to the specific strengths and weaknesses of the party present. Similarly there are a handful of fixed events listed below which are likely to occur differently. The standard campaign is aimed at being more of a guide to using this setting rather than a direct campaign you can run for your PCs.

\subsection{Session 1: Introduction - Welcome to Dunmar}
\begin{quotebox}
"Welcome to Dunmar," proclaims the gruff man leading the caravan. You met him as Du'ruk, a barbaric looking man veiled in a mystery he created for himself. He only shared with you his first name as he invited you to join his caravan headed to the wonderous city of Dunmar, and over the past few weeks you have built your own suspicions that he was hiding the fact he was actually a half-orc under the various cloths he covered himself with.

As you come closer behind him the valley opens up before you. Bordered on 3 sides by mountains. On the far side you see the majestic city of of Dunmar. Its glorious peaks and towers of the main keep rising high above a city squatted on the side of a mountain.

This world, Renga, is a mess. Split into two domains, the light and vast Upcrust and the dangerous dark lands of Lowcrust. Your journey starts here and within the caravan chatter begins to pick up as people get more excited about being near the end of their long journey.
\end{quotebox}

At this point let the party describe their characters and share with one another the information they have chosen to share. Once they are done describe how over time they draw nearer to the city, at this point in time it makes sense to explain to them a little bit of how the world works.

\begin{quotebox}
Renga is quite a small world if you compare it to most, to travel all the way around the world on Upcrust it will take a little over 3 months by foot, and as such this means when big things happen they happen fast. At the edges of the land-masses making up Upcrust are sheer cliffs dropping down to the wintery wasteland of Lowcrust. While Upcrust is summery and warm and has only a single large body of water beside all of its networks of rivers Lowcrust is the polar opposite - most of Lowcrust is large seas of frozen water and where the cliffs lead up to Upcrust there are huge cave networks containing strange and terrible beasts. There are only two cities on Lowcrust but they are monolithic expanses that take days to travel through.

Let us head back to your travels, as you grow nearer to Dunmar the road you were following widens and various carts carrying different goods to different parts of the valley pass in both directions. Nearing the edge of the city vendors with their carts are calling out with their wares "fresh fish, caught this morning...". "fruits, healthy for the soul..", "spell components, get your magical means fulfilled here..." the caravan heads through without losing speed.

As you get to the gates at the outer wall you notice a party of armored men making a beeline to you. Their armor decorated with copper images of lions they quickly meet up with the caravan. With a booming voice the leader exclaims "my friend Du'ruk, it has been too long!" he removes his helmet after dismounting his horse and embraces Du'ruk. The man is heavily built and looks like pure muscle, his flowing red hair and beard you would not have believed would fit in his helmet had he not just taken it off. "Ah Renton, maybe not long enough" Du'ruk replies. The step to the side and have a jovial conversation littered with laughter and tom-foolery, it is clear they are old friends.

One of the soldiers that arrived with Renton begins to inspect the wagons and the people that you traveled with while the other reads from a scroll, "Welcome to Dunmar, there are a few important rules we need to make clear to you before you run free in out city.." - he essentially rambles on but you get the gist of it. The city is happy for you to do anything as long as it respects the people around you and after the third chime of the church bell after sundown not to make noise. The inspection ends fairly quickly and it is obvious this is a place of peace, they aren't expecting trouble from anyone and are ready to move on to more important matters.

Du'ruk turns to the caravan and leads you to a nearby inn, you are told the first night is complementary. You take your things to your rooms and meet up for a hearty dinner. In the common room you are treated to a hearty beef stew, all the beer you can drink and being tired from travelling you all head to bed soon after your fantastic evening entertainment.
\end{quotebox}

Let your PCs explain how they sleep, and how they feel and make a rool for passive perception throughout the night.

First check: DC 15 Perception - whomever passes this check is awoken, in the distance you can hear something that does not sound like a quiet city night. Checking outside through a window you can hear towards the gate you entered the city there is some commotion, nothing completely out of hand but there is definitely some small fight.

Second check: DC 10 Perception - whomever passes this check is now alert, there are definitely sounds outside near the inn that shouldnt occur in these late hours of the night. Looking outside people will see a party of hooded figures stealthily advancing down the road past the inn, every person they come in contact with they are poking with a a needle and the people are falling unconscious.

Third check: When any played confronts or tries to fight a hooded figure there will be a cry, and this wakes up the rest of the PCs.

In the road in front of the inn passing are 8 hooded figures (DM note: these are all minions of Illuminated - 7 squire of Bristlebow [lv.1 minion] and 1 knight of bristlebow [lv.2 knight] - they will try to be peaceful towards the PCs. Special mechanics their attacks are replaced with "Knock Out Needle" see below).

In passing hooded figures in range will try hit anyone in their way with a "Knock Out Needle", on a successful hit on a PC they will realise that the PCs are not "Worldly" beings and their leader will try talk to the PCs (see below), similarly if a PC downs one of the hooded figures with an attack they will stop running past and back off and try use their "Knock Out Needle" avoiding combat. They are lightly armed so easier to hit but also dodge attacks with advantage.

	\textit{A small non-lethal poisoned needle.}\\

	\begin{itemaction}[Action: Jab]
		Jab a character with a neede to try knock them out.\\
		Roll 1d20+5 to hit versus AC:\\
		Hit on wordly character: the character is instantly knocked out.\\
		Hit on PC or unworldly character: the character becomes drowsy and actions are taken at a disadvantage for 5 minutes
	\end{itemaction}
\end{itembox}

It is nearly innevitable that the players will attempt to use some form of magic. This will trigger a magical trap (several of which are hidden around the city) which launches a red flair into the air above the city and calls for guards from the garisson to come and stop whomever is breaking the magic-after-dark rules of Dunmar.
