\section{About}
Curse Caverns is a dungeon that can be run as a once-off for 3 to 6 level 5 characters in the setting of Dunmar (see: Dunmar's DM Guide for more information). The cavern is in Downcrust near the city of Shalk and is rated as high difficulty.

\subsection{Optional Rule: Insanity}
The curse of the caverns is far reaching, but if you want to add a mechanic of insanity you can use it to balance rewards for players as they progress.
