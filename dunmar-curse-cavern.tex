\section{About}
This one-off is built in the Dunmar setting (see: Dunmar DM Guide) and is of high difficulty for 3 to 6 level 5 characters. It is recommended you play with the optional mechanic "Insanity". \\

There are two ways you can run this, a simple mode or an extensive mode. The extensive mode would require multiple levels of dungeon and a few days worth of adventuring (4 or more sessions of 3 hours) whereas the simple mode is geared towards a single session. Options marked "[Extend]" are additional place and happenings you can introduce.

\subsection{Optional Rule: Insanity}

\section{Chapter 1: Introduction}
\begin{quotebox}
As you move tiredly into Shalk, a city on the lower crust of Rengar you are awestruck by the sheer magnitude and beauty. The whole city built from shards of the rock-hard ice all around reflecting lights of differing colour all around. As you cross the threshold, not marked but clearly an obvious border the bustling city opens up below you cut into the ice. \\

A dragonborn in light armor near you rushes up, "sirs, madams, your attention! The king, his lord Vesti Dragon of Shalk has put a bounty on a magical item and will reward adventuring parties that would bring it back for him." As he proclaims this he hurriedly shoves carefully wrapped scrolls into each person that arrived with's hands, each tied by a quaint blue ribbon. \\

"Time is short, the meeting is a few minutes from now at the Bottlesworth Bar,| he hurriedly shouts the directions to the bar and heads off.\\

Opening the scroll in ornate lettering: The king will award the bearer of this document 10000gp for the successful retrieving and handing in of a magical item of his interest. More information at the Bottlesworth Bar at noon on the eve of the new moon. \\

The promise of adventure and riches is definitely enough to pique the interest of many and after a short trip you make your way to the bar. A gentleman takes the stage as you start filling up the last seat, clears his throat and begins to talk "in 3 hours time a magical portal to a set of hidden caverns North of the city will open, this happens once every 20 years and we have predicted it will be open today, so as you can tell time is short and being hasty is important. These caverns are only open for 3 days and are extremely dangerous, if you are no longer interested, this is your last chance to leave..." \\

He glances around the room and is greeted with a deathly silence, "good" he continues. A surly man at the door closes and bars it from the inside. "We have a request from the king himself - he is interested in a hidden works that was lost in the Curse Caverns - the book contains information key to him ascending to a higher plane and thus he wants it." \\

"The compensation as you know is very worthy of the deeds it will take to retrieve it but the caverns are not in our domain of control and are full of traps. We have a hidden pathway out of here that leads to entrances to the caverns which you can use - we need to be discrete as other groups are seeking the writings themselves."
